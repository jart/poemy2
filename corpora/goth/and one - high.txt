Of course you're not afraid of doing,
You said to me,
Touch the face of faith and come alone,
I will lead you by the hand,
Through the heavy sea,
Take place on my back, hold on tight,
Cause I take a run to fly...

High...
High as the sun,
We will leave dear old mother,
Where life has begun.
High...
High as the moon,
We're so glad we decided,
To meet our doom.

Want to strike,
And leave a crater,
Like a shooting star,
Burning with our tails,
The gods' white hair.
Now wake up from coma,
To hear what I have to say,
Take place on my back, hold on tight,
Cause I take a run to fly...

High...
High as the sun,
We will leave dear old mother,
Where life has begun.
High...
High as the moon,
We're so glad we decided,
To meet our doom.
