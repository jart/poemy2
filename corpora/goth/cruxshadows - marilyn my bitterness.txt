I don't understand
why you've done these things to me
I can not comprehend
your lack of loyalty

For you i would have shaken down
the heavens from the sky
But it seems my love was stronger than
this love of yours that died

Did you think it wouldn't hurt
Did you think I wouldn't feel
when the world came falling down
or maybe you didn't think at all
and that's why I feel what I feel now

Did you think I wouldn't bawl
Did you think I wouldn't cry
Did you think I wouldn't beg you to stay
One of these days you're gonna realize
just what you've thrown away

Now I lie here in this empty bed
and all I think about is you
and I wonder if you miss me now
and if your bed is empty too

Did you think it wouldn't hurt
Did you think I wouldn't feel
When the world came falling down
Or maybe you didn't think at all
and that's why i feel what i feel now

did you think i wouldn't bawl
did you think i wouldn't cry
did you think i wouldn't beg you to stay
one of these days you're gonna recognize
just who you've thrown away

Marilyn my bitterness
i've fallen to a stranger nightmare
Marilyn oh Marilyn
I can not break away

Marilyn oh Marilyn
I've fallen to stranger nightmare
Marilyn oh Marilyn
I can not find my way

I'll absorb this agony
I'll carry all this pain
I'll wipe away this emptiness
I will purify this stain
my wings will fold around me now
for once a one was two
and my memory is a monument
that will always stand for you

Did you think it wouldn't hurt
Did you think I wouldn't feel
When the world came falling down
Or maybe you didn't think at all
and that's why i feel what i feel now

did you think i wouldn't bawl
did you think i wouldn't cry
did you think i wouldn't beg you to stay
one of these days you're gonna recognize
just who you've thrown away

Marilyn my bitterness
i've fallen to a stranger nightmare
Marilyn oh Marilyn
I can not break away

Marilyn my bitterness
I've fallen to stranger nightmare
Marilyn oh Marilyn
I can not find my way

Marilyn my bitterness
i've fallen to a stranger nightmare
Marilyn oh Marilyn
I can not break away

Marilyn my bitterness
i've fallen to a stranger nightmare
Marilyn oh Marilyn
I can not find my way

Marilyn my bitterness
i've fallen to a stranger nightmare
Marilyn oh Marilyn
I can not find my way

Marilyn my bitterness
I've fallen to a stranger nightmare
Marilyn oh Marilyn
Now must I go away?
