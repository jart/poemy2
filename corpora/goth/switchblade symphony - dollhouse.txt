Pushing, pulling me down again
Pushing, pulling me down again
It's getting bad
I can't breathe
I won't let them in
I won't let them in
Crushing, pushing me down again
Crushing, pushing me down again
I need to get away
Listen now to their hurting words
They rip and they do tear
Pushing out all of my hidden things
Hold my hand and take me there
Sickened eyes seem to mesmerize
They're melting as they glow
Mesmerize your alibis
They're laughing in the snow
People climbing up the walls
Breaking all of my wretched dolls
Fingernails they scratch outside
In the attic is where i'll hide
People climbing up the walls
Breaking all of my wretched dolls
Fingernails they scratch outside
In the attic is where i'll hide
I won't let them in
