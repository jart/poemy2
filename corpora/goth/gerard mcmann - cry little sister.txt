Last fire will rise
behind those eyes
Black house will rock
blind boys don't lie
Immortal fear
that voice so clear
Through broken walls
that scream I hear

Cry little sister
Come, come to your brother
Unchain me sister
Love is with your brother

The masquerade
strangers look up
When will they learn
this loneliness?

Temptation heat
beats like a drum
Deep in your veins
I will not lie to little sister

Come, come to your brother
Unchain me sister
Love is with your brother

My shangrila
I can't forget
Why you were mine
I need you now

Cry little sister
Come, come to your brother
Unchain me sister
Love is with your brother

Cry little sister
Come, come to your brother
Unchain me sister
Love is with your brother
Cry, little sister
