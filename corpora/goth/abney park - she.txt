She has always watched over me 
She takes good care of me 
She is such an integral part of me 
That I forgot who I was 
And I forgot she was there 
For me 

We have traveled this world for years 
We have consoled each other's fears 
We dried each other's tears 
Yet always in doubt, and never in bed 
Of we 

With a fever, with a passion 
Within anger or with compassion 
In a rage, when distrustful 
When she's screaming or when she's lustful 
With the fever, with a passion 
When in anger or in compassion 
In a rage, when distrustful 
When she's screaming and when she's lustful 

With the fever, with a passion 
When in anger or in compassion 
In a rage, when distrustful 
When she's screaming and when she's lustful 

She has always watched over me 
She takes good care of me 
She is such an integral part of me 
That I forgot who I was 
And I forgot she was there 
For me 

We have traveled this world for years 
We have consoled each other's fears 
We dried each other's tears 
Yet always in doubt, and never in bed 
Of we 

With a fever, with a passion 
Within anger or with compassion 
In a rage, when distrustful 
When she's screaming or when she's lustful 
With the fever, with a passion 
When in anger or in compassion 
In a rage, when distrustful 
When she's screaming and when she's lustful
