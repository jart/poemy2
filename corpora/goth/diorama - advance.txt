life-exhaling sleep petrified in marbleized composure
as I drown in her calm breathing
I start to live beyond her notions
faking balance - obvious easy

bright-inspiring dark
that is never to be brightened
sphinx-like stupid I surrender
poets comment poets never change
paralyzed with sadness here I am

carry me - anywhere and she’ll be waiting
let me be - resting by her patiently and
maybe she - will shatter all the truth inside my
agony - a promised word to save the silence

life-inhaling sleep
and above me heavens full of roses
full of orchids glittering in the moonlight
dream-absorbing stars reflect in her eyes
leave me very restless

carry me - anywhere and she’ll be waiting
let me be - resting by her patiently and
maybe she - will shatter all the truth inside my
agony - a promised word to save the silence

life-recovering sleep
reveling in self-contained illusions
illusive flowers obey the dawn
is it my way ramifying before me
paralyzed with sadness here I am

carry me - anywhere and she’ll be waiting
let me be - resting by her patiently and
maybe she - will shatter all the truth inside my
agony - a promised word to save the silence
