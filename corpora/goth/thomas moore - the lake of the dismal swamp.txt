They made her a grave too cold and damp 
For a soul so warm and true; 
And she's gone to the Lake of the Dismal Swamp, 
Where all night long, by a firefly lamp, 
She paddles her white canoe. 

And her firefly lamp I soon shall see, 
And her paddle I soon shall hear; 
Long and moving our life shall be 
And I'll hide the maid in a cypress tree, 
When the footstep of death is near." 

Away to the Dismal Swamp he speeds,
His path was rugged and sore, 
Through tangled juniper, beds of reeds, 
Through many a fen where the serpent feeds, 
And man never trod before. 

And when on the earth he sank to sleep, 
If slumber his eyelids knew, 
He lay where the deadly vine doth weep 
Its venemous tear, and nightly steep 
The flesh with blistering dew! 

And near him the she-wolf stirr'd the brake, 
And the copper-snake breathed in his ear, 
Till he starting cried, from his dream awake, 
"Oh when shall I see the dusky Lake, 
And the white canoe of my dear?" 

He saw the Lake, and a meteor bright 
Quick over its surface play'd,
"Welcome," he said, "my dear one's light!" 
And the dim shore echo'd for many a night 
The name of the death-cold maid. 

Till he hollow'd a boat of the birchen bark, 
Which carried him off from the shore; 
Far, far he follow'd the meteor spark, 
The wind was high and the clouds were dark, 
And the boat return'd no more. 

But oft, from the Indian hunter's camp, 
This lover and maid so true 
Are seen at the hour of midnight damp 
To cross the Lake by a firefly lamp, 
And paddle their white canoe!
