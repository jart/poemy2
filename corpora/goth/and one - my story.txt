So you should have seen me years ago
Time was never on my side you know
The stars shine even brighter
Just before they die
And scars could tell a story
All the sense to light

I open doors I open minds
Telling stories telling lies
This is my story
Fearing the feelings of you

I feel no regrets for gone by days
'cause they're like a summer bird
That leaves or stays
So how you will understand I had to lie
Some stars shine even brighter
Just before they die

I open doors I open minds
Telling stories telling lies
This is my story
Fearing the feelings of you
