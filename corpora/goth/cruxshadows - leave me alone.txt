Leave me alone- I'm a freak
leave me alone- make it easy for yourself
everywhere I go they all stare
I don't understand why they care
they stare at me all in black
and when I turn they stare at my back
all these things can't,
all these things don't...
let me go.
Leave me alone- I'm a freak
leave me alone- make it easy for yourself
everywhere I go they all stare
I don't understand why they care
and I don't want to be part of your world
and I don't want to see the things you see
can't you understand how I feel?
can't you let me be?

Leave, leave me alone
Leave, leave me alone
Leave, leave me alone
Leave, leave me alone
