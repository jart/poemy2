We've come too far to turn back
It's way too dark to unpack
We'd stop right here but we're slipping
This ground is loose, we're not gripping

We're way in over our heads, it seems
And this place is coming apart at the seams
We can't stop or control our direction
The further we go, the less protection

Suddenly the beast takes notice
Unexpectedly we've earned his focus
We got here by a naive assumption
Our confidence was a false presumption

We're way in over our heads, it seems
And this place is coming apart at the seams
We can't stop or control our direction

The further we go, the less protection

We've come too far to turn back
It's way too dark to unpack
We'd stop right here but we're slipping
This ground is loose, we're not gripping

We're way in over our heads, it seems
And this place is coming apart at the seams
We can't stop or control our direction
The further we go, the less protection

We've come too far
We've come too far
It's way too dark
It's way too dark
We've come too far
We've come too far
