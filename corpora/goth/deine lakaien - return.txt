"Waves in low tide
Sounds of the night
And my memories echo "back again!"
Stranger that I am
In my own land
Where noone will remember my name

When you hear me calling,
Will you be there?
When you see me falling,
Will you be there?

Time was the force
Brought me back on course
In the darkness distant fires on a strand
Time is my disguise
Against hostile seeking eyes
And the waves wipe out my footprints in the sand

When you hear me calling,
Will you be there?
When you see me falling,
Will you be there?

Now my time has come
Return into the sun
'Cause I've always been searching for you
If I win, if I lose
No charge, no excuse
All my wanderings made sure: "My aims are true!"

When you hear me calling,
Will you be there?
When you see me falling,
Will you be there?"
