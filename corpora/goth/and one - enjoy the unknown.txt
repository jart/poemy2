My present to you
The sweetest tattoo
Collapsing hearts in redest blue
You will be scared by signs on your pillow
He's not your man - no!

The poems i wrote revealing the code
To my thoughts which help to note
That i realized your deepest desire
Pick up the phone - enjoy the unknown

Your smile on tv means nothing to me
'Cause you are all you could be
I feel sorry about the death of your pet!

Enjoy the unknown
Always always
Enjoy the unknown
Always always
The end is near
We're dying here
Always always
Enjoy the unknown
Creep around your window
