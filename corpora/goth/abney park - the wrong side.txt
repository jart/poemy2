I live on the wrong side of life, 
I'm the one you fear as you hold your wife. 
I run were the darker crowds run. 
On the rain swept streets were black rain runs. 

I play were the darker kids play 
I'm the one who goes out when you end your day. 
I dance were the darker crowds dance, 
In the pitch black clubs in a clove stained trance 

I see things the darker kids see 
Though you wouldn't believe all that's happened to me. 
I've been to the backside of hell, 
And Iâ€™ve played with your fear and enjoyed it well 

This our time, the nights our day 
We'll dance this fading life away.
