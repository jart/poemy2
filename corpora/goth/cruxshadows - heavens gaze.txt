Shades of feelings my heart denies
bathing in shadows hidden in the eyes of lies
my glowing future now these embers burn
uncanny restlessness- but ask me what I've
learned...

prey insect visions swarm about my head
each haunted thought, and each prying wedge
slice ripping pieces and shredding pages of life
if this is real- well it feels like hell! yes it feels
like Hell!

gods and angels and devils smile
stare into our crying eyes
fire and anger and hate beguile
but look into your heart tonight.

We disregard the cold pedestrian grey
where level playing fields weren't meant for us
to play
as riddled failings salvation turns away
if this is real- well it feels like hell! yes it feels
like Hell!

gods and angels and devils smile
look into our crying eyes
fire and anger and hate beguile
but look into your heart tonight.

gods and angels and devils smile
stare into our crying eyes
fire and anger and hate beguile
but look into your heart tonight.
