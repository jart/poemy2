It's getting dark... too soon... a threatening silence...
Surrounding me... a wind comes up from the islands...
Distance fades to stormy grey
Washed out from the deep of the ocean
Here I will stand to face your wrath...
While all the others are praying

Calm down my heart...don't beat so fast
Don't be afraid just once in a lifetime

No rain can wash away my tears
No wind can soothe my pain
You made me doubt, you made me fear
But now I'm not the same
You took my wife, my unborn son...
Torn into the deep of the ocean
I don't pretend that I love you
'Cause there is nothing left to loose

And when silence comes back to me
I find myself feeling lonely
Standing here the shores of destiny
I find myself feeling lonely
I had a life to give... many dreams to live...
Don't you know that you're losing so much this time
Beyond the waves... I will be free
While all the others are praying

Calm down my heart...

The love in you, it does not burn,
There is no lesson you can learn
And there are sounds you cannot hear,
And there are feelings you can't feel

Calm down my heart...don't beat so fast
Don't be afraid just once in a lifetime

I don't pretend that I love you
And this time I'm not scared of you
