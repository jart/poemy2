We need your blood
We need your flesh
We want to see you fade to black 

Do you like our white skin?
Do you like our eyes?
Do you want to follow us through the night? 

We are your pleasure,
We are your destiny...
We are your pleasure,
We are your destiny... 

We're living in the the darkness,
We hate the day
We're hunting in the night,
Take your children away 

Your blood is our pleasure we want your soul
You will never die as a child of the night 

We're living in the darkness,
We hate the day
We're hiding in the shadow,
To the moon we pray 

We are the creatures of the night,
We want your blood
We're the seduction of evil,
Want to conquer your world 

We want to lick your blond
We want to kiss your neck
Like a taste of sin 

You will live forever
You will never die
Come and take my hand 

We're living in the the darkness,
We hate the day
We're hunting in the night,
Take your children away 

Your blood is our pleasure we want your soul
You will never die as a child of the night 

We're living in the darkness,
We hate the day
We're hiding in the shadow,
To the moon we pray 

We are the creatures of the night,
We want your blood
We're the seduction of evil,
Want to conquer your world
