Let me touch your skin
Let me see your eyes 

You will taste this sweet pain
You will like to suffer for me 

See the light in my eyes
Feel the razorblades on your skin 

See your sparking blood
Let me drink your life 

And in my world of temptation
I will wait for you
I'll show you all the pleasures
There's so much we can do
Don't be afraid my darling
Let me be your guiding light
Don't be afraid my darling
There's no reason for you to hide 

I kiss you from your feet
To your open mouth 

I can hear you cry
When your blood begins to flow 

I can smell your flesh
I can see your greedy eyes 

You like to kiss me
With your bloody lips 

And in my world of temptation
I will wait for you
I'll show you all the pleasures
There's so much we can do
Don't be afraid my darling
Let me be your guiding light
Don't be afraid my darling
There's no reason for you to hide
