Dreams lie shattered shards endure now the wraiths her mindpossess
like shells of precious flowers dried out and hung with love
making eyes into frozen temples that stale you in her gaze
so pale so cold so beautiful if not clinically insane

now the decades pass unanswered and she prays with silent lips
sometimes she talks to angels when she has her little fits
but you must believe in something - sometime that something'sreal
sometimes our motivations are tied up in what we feel

so elegant her poetry falls from her pallid lips
she flows like icy roadways when the wheels start to slip
and if her course lays waste to this i pray away to your design
her minions shall dance your dreaming eyes and sing her fragilerhymes

now the decades pass unanswered and she prays with silent lips
sometimes she talks to angels when she has her little fits
but you must believe in something - sometime that something'sreal
sometimes our motivations are tied up in what we feel

Ave Maria
just give us something
but it's lost on deafened ears
Ave Maria
just give us something
to ears that cannot hear

now the decades pass unanswered and she prays with silent lips
sometimes she talks to angels when she has her little fits
but you must believe in something - sometime that something'sreal
sometimes our motivations are tied up in what we feel

Ave Maria
just give us something
but it's lost on deafened ears
Ave Maria
she's saying something
to ears that cannot hear

Ave Maria
just give us something
but it's lost on deafened ears
Ave Maria
if god is speaking
she's the only one who hears.
