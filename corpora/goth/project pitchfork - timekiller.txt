Go away leave me alone
I feel your presence in my mind
the time seems to stop I set you free
you calm my mind you calm my mind
make my dreams come true - baby
every time it seems to me
that fiction and reality melt together for eternity
liquid words dropping down the stairs
filling the emptiness with sense
you and me on the floor floating on our sensibility

you need a timekiller and you don't understand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand
I am your timekiller I let your mind expand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand

tick tock tick tock madness comes tonight
what's reality compared to me
I rest on the bed and I'm sure I slowly get mad
I'm in a state of mind which makes me blind
for the fact that I'm a man
I'm here to stay forever but not today

you need a timekiller and you don't understand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand
I am your timekiller I let your mind expand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand

in my heart is no place for you
and in my mind is no space for you
the exit already melted away
and now there's nothing left to say

you need a timekiller and you don't understand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand
I am your timekiller I let your mind expand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand
