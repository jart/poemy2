Mother of motion, the eyes can't capture time,
falling emotion, the blind now lead the blind,
we commit indiscretions, and omit our sins from sight,
in a world of intangibles, too many things seem right

No hand to scribe, the sinking sickness I have seen,
no face to judge until you've been the monster I have been,
to hunger is noble, where beauty is silent sleep,
my hunger is noble, but my pain is driven deep.

Cruelty and consequence cannot eliminate this relevance
Your selfishness, your hatefulness cannot take away my immanence
Cruelty and consequence cannot eliminate this relevance
Your selfishness, your hatefulness cannot take away my innocence from me

Mother of motion, the eyes can't capture time,
