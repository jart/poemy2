The art of suicide
Nightgowns and hair
Curls flying every which where
The pain too pure to hide 
Bridges of Sighs 
Meant to conceal lover's lies 
Under the arches
Of moonlight and sky 
Suddenly easy
To contemplate why 
Why... 

Why live a life 
That's painted with pity
And sadness and strife 
Why dream a dream 
That's tainted with trouble
And less than it seems 
Why bother bothering 
Just for a poem
Or another sad song to sing 
Why live a life 
Why live a life 

The art of suicide
Pretty and clean 
Conveys a theatrical scene 
"Alas, I'm gone!" she cried 
Ankles displayed 
Melodramatically laid
Under the arches
Of moonlight and sky 
Suddenly easy
To contemplate why 
Why... 

Why live a life 
That's painted with pity
And sadness and strife 
Why dream a dream 
That's tainted with trouble
And less than it seems 
Why bother bothering 
Just for a poem
Or another sad song to sing 
Why live a life 
Why live a life 

Life is not like Gloomy Sunday 
With a second ending
When the people are disturbed 
Well they should be disturbed 
Because there's a story
That ought to be heard 
Life is not like a gloomy Sunday 
With a second ending
When the people are disturbed 
Well they should be disturbed 
Because there's a lesson
That really ought to be learned 

The world is full of poets 
We don't need any more 
The world is full of singers 
We don't need any more 
The world is full of lovers 
We don't need any more...
