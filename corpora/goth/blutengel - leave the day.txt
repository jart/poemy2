This is the night,
Where all your dreams come true.
I'll catch your life,
I'll paralyze your soul.

Show me your fear,
It's time to break the chains.
Turn off the light,
Salvation comes to you this night.

And you're hiding in the darkness,
Spread your arms and try to fly.
But the pain you feel is stronger,
You're too weak to touch the sky.

And the tears that you are crying,
Is the price you have to pay.
We will guide you through the shadows,
Take our hands, we'll leave the day.

Regret your sins,
With every breath you take.
You try to run,
But I will hold you back.

You lost your way,
With every step you make.
And all your fears,
Growing every second, you will stay.

Feel the pain inside your heart,
Your crystal teardrops fade to black...

And you're hiding in the darkness,
Spread your arms and try to fly.
But the pain you feel is stronger,
You're too weak to touch the sky.

And the tears that you are crying,
Is the price you have to pay.
We will guide you through the shadows,
Take our hands, we'll leave the day.

Try to fly... Try to fly...

And you're hiding in the darkness,
Spread your arms and try to fly.
But the pain you feel is stronger,
You're too weak to touch the sky.

And the tears that you are crying,
Is the price you have to pay.
We will guide you through the shadows,
Take our hands, we'll leave the day.

Try to fly... Try to fly...
