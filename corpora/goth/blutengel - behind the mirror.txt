Who's the man in the mirror
Who's the man inside of me
What happened to my life
Is this what I used to be

I have strange seductive feelings
I feel hunger for the night
Who's the man in the mirror
Can he help me out of here

I walk on the water
I never sleep at night
I feel no sorrow for the lost
I feel like an newborn child
I walk on the water
I see colours in the sky
I hear sirens call my name
It's the world behind the mirror
