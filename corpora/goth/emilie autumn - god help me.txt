God help me
I don't see
How I can live this way
Any I don't know why he's
Touching me
Won't you shine in my direction and help me
Won't you lend me your protection and help me

God help me
And just maybe
I'll learn to help myself
Speak to me
Don't leave me
He's burning me
Won't you shine in my direction and help me
Won't you lend me your protection and help me

Am I guilty or am I just waiting around
For the tide to come in
So the truth can come out
And if I had a dollar for every time
I repented the sin
And commit the same crime
I'd be sitting on top of the world
I'd be sitting on top of the world

Places everyone, this is a test
Throw your stones, do your damage
All the world is a judge
But that doesn't compare
To what I do to myself when you're not there
And if I had a dollar for every time
I repented the sin
And commit the same crime
I'd be sitting on top of the world
I'd be sitting on top of the world

Don't make me choose
I've got much to lose
For I am with you
And also with you
For I am with you
And also with you
