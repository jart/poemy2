I'm your Opheliac 
I've been so disillusioned 
I know you'd take me back 
But still I feign confusion 
I couldn't be your friend 
My world was too unstable 
You might have seen the end 

But you were never able
To keep me breathing 
As the water rises up again
Before I slip away 

You know the games I play 
And the words I say 
When I want my own way 
You know the lies I tell 
When you've gone through hell 
And I say I can't stay 
You know how hard it can be
To keep believing in me 
When everything and everyone
Becomes my enemy and when
There's nothing more you can do 
I'm gonna blame it on you 
It's not the way I want to be 
I only hope that in the end you will see 
It's the Opheliac in me 

I'm your Opheliac 
My stockings prove my virtues
I'm open to attack 
But I don't want to hurt you 
Whether I swim or sink 
That's no concern of yours now
How could you possibly think 
You had the power to know how
To keep me breathing 
As the water rises up again
Before I slip away 

You know the games I play 
And the words I say 
When I want my own way 
You know the lies I tell 
When you've gone through hell 
And I say I can't stay 
You know how hard it can be
To keep believing in me 
When everything and everyone
Becomes my enemy and when
There's nothing more you can do 
I'm gonna blame it on you 
It's not the way I want to be 
I only hope that in the end you will see 
It's the Opheliac in me 

Studies show:
Intelligent girls are more depressed 
Because they know
What the world is really like 
Don't think for a beat it makes it better 
When you sit her down and tell her
Everything gonna be all right 
She knows in society she either is
A devil or an angel with no in between 
She speaks in the third person
So she can forget that she's me 

Doubt thou the stars are fire 
Doubt thou the sun doth move
Doubt truth to be a liar 
But never doubt 
Doubt thou the stars are fire 
Doubt thou the sun doth move
Doubt truth to be a liar 
But never doubt I love

You know the games I play 
And the words I say 
When I want my own way 
You know the lies I tell 
When you've gone through hell 
And I say I can't stay 
You know how hard it can be
To keep believing in me 
When everything and everyone
Becomes my enemy and when
There's nothing more you can do 
I'm gonna blame it on you 
It's not the way I want to be 
I only hope that in the end you will see 
It's the Opheliac in me
