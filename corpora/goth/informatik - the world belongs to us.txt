Look around
At the world today
Our precious home
Withers in decay
what once was ours
is now torn and stayed
we wondered how
it got this way

Years will come
Years will go
kingdoms rise and fall
the time has to take control
the world belongs to us

the years will come
the years will go
kingdoms rise and fall
the time has come to take control
the world belongs to us

Long ago
a choice was made
the human rules
the rest obey
now we are taught
how to behave
don't question why
and don't complain

the world belongs to us...

Years will come
Years will go
kingdoms rise and fall
the time has to take control
the world belongs to us

a single drop of water
becomes a mighty fall
People of the Earth
The world belongs to us

now its time
to demonstrate
that you and I
can make history
tear down the walls
that separate
to make us weak
and keep us afraid

years will come
years will go
kingdoms rise and fall
the time has to take control
the world belongs to us

a single drop of water 
becomes a mighty fall
people of the earth
the world belongs to us

years will come
years will go
kingdoms rise and fall
the time has to take control
the world belongs to us

a single drop of water 
becomes a mighty fall
people of the earth
the world belongs to us
