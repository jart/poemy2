Pulsing in the lines a better world is arising
Floating in the stream our future is being transported
Nothing can stop this universal way of living
But where are the souls of millions dead in hunger

Don't look to the other side

Don't see, can't see
Future is a place to live
You see, can see
Mankind is not free
Don't see, can't see
Future is a place to live
You see, can see
Mankind is not free

Please dont' tell me lies of clean and bright tomorrows
Listen to the news, something big is going to happen
Closing the frontiers is our last solution
And when they want to fight we call it holy war

Don't look to the other side
