Overland, you could take these lifeless hands in yours,
Breathe into me, things I gave up praying for.
Tired of shadow play, through a darker gaze,
Will you take what I want you to?
Will you forsake things you never should?

It's time. Time to set the world alight. 

Set your spirit free,
Come across the sky to me,
Give in to insanity,
The Witching Hour.
Wait for me behind the door,
I'll throw your body to the floor,
We will be apart no more,
The Witching Hour.

Can you feel, the fire that's burning me inside?
As your touch, darkens your betraying smile.
Cast unrest aside, it's time to come alive,
I don't think I need to tell you,
Such a mirrored ride

Set your spirit free,
Come across the sky to me,
Give in to insanity,
The Witching Hour.
Wait for me behind the door,
I'll throw your body to the floor,
We will be apart no more,
The Witching Hour.
