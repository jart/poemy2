Your Hand in my Hand, and my Hand in your Hand 
Your Hand in my Hand...Closeness of the Past 
My Hand in your Hand, and your Hand in my Hand 
Jerking back and nothing will last 

I have to go before it is too late 
Have to wipe out the Traces, and Memories will fade 
And Tears will stop flowing - and Tears will stop flowing 
And Memories will fade....and Memories will fade; 

Over and done, over and done 
Over and done, over and done 

Dead and frozen my Heart - over and done 
My Life falling apart - over and done 

Dead and frozen my Heart - over and done 
My Life falling apart - over and done 
Over and done..... 
Over and done 

Your Voice in my Voice, and my Voice in your Voice 
Your Voice in my Voice.....sweet Echoes of the Past 

Your Voice from the Callbox, your Voice at the Door 
Don't want that anymore - and nothing will last 

Have to plug my Eyes before it's too late 
Have to put on the Glow - and Memories will fade 
And tears will stop flowing and tears will stop flowing 
And Memories will fade, and Memories will fade 

Over and done, over and done 
Over and done - over and done 

Dead and frozen my Heart - over and done 
My Life falling apart - over and done 

Dead and frozen my Heart - over and done 
My Life falling apart.....over and done 

Your Eyes in my Eyes, and my Eyes in your Eyes; 
Your Eyes in my Eyes....faint Glimmer of the Past 

My Eyes in your Eyes and your Eyes in my Eyes 
Shine turns dull: and nothing will last 

Have to look away, before it's too late! 
Have to put out the Fire - and Memories will fade 

And Tears will stop flowing, and Tears will stop flowing 
And Memories will fade - and Memories will fade.... 

Over and done, over and done 
Over and done - over and done 

Dead and frozen my Heart - over and done 
My Life falling apart, over and done 

Dead and frozen my Heart - over and done 
My Life falling apart - over and done; 

My only Sun: over and done 
My only Sun, over and done 

Over and done....over and done
