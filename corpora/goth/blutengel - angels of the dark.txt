You're walking through the streets at night
And your heart is full of pain
You don't know where to go
Your life is full of hate and fears
You feel so lost and you feel alone
You're looking for a change in your life

You hate to be a human being
You hate to be so sick and weak
You don't deserve a life like this
You're so much better and you're so different
You don't believe in what they do
I know you are one of us

We are the angels of the dark
We're everything you'll ever need
We have the darkness on our side
It will guide us to a better life
No more fear and no more pain
We will protect you eternally
The only price you have to pay is to leave this world behind

You hate to be a human being
You hate to be so sick and weak
You don't deserve a life like this
You're so much better and you're so different
You don't believe in what they do
I know you are one of us

We are the angels of the dark
We're everything you'll ever need
We have the darkness on our side
It will guide us to a better life
The world is dying without faith
Only we will win this game
You will find a better life
In a world without sacrifice
No more fear and no more pain
We will protect you eternally
The only price you have to pay is to leave this world behind

The world is dying without faith
Only we will win this game
You will find a better life
