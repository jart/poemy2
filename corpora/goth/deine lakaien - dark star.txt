Wandering about in a universe
Back and forth - torn
Strandgoods of the galaxies
Back and forth - torn
Exhausted, starved, yet still a hunter,
Hidden, lurking behind some planets,
In noarrow lanes, in narrow lanes ...

Dark star you are the light of my night
Dark star won't you be my guide
Dark star why do you run from me
Dark star why don't you kill me

How long ago when i ran into you
Spark discharges - dazzeled
Since that moment I've lost my way
Back and forth - dazzeled
Exhausted, starved, yet still a hunter,
Hidden, lurking behind some planets,
"Faster ! Faster !"

Dark star you are the light of my night
Dark star won't you be my guide
Dark star why do you run from me
Dark star why don't you kill me

Moona and planets passing by
Faded through light - blind
Men forged to black mountains
Faded through love - blind
Screens may de distorted
Raders may be deaf
Hunting for love, hunting for love

Dark star you are the light of my night
Dark star won't you be my guide
Dark star why do you run from me
Dark star why don't you kill me
