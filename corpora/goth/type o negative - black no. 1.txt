I went looking for trouble and boy - i found her

She's in love with herself - she likes the dark
on her milk white neck - the Devil's mark

Now it's all Hallows Eve - the moon is full
will she trick or treat - i bet she will
she will - happy halloween - baby

She's got a date at midnight - with Nosferatu
oh baby, Lilly Munster - ain't got nothing on you

Well when i called her evil - she just laughed
well cast that spell on me - boo bitch craft

Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
you can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
dye em black - dye em black

Little wolf skin boots - and clove cigarettes
an erotic funeral - for witch she's dressed
her perfume smells like - burning leaves
everyday is halloween

Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
you can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
dye em black - dye em black
loving you was like loving the dead
she dyes it black number one
