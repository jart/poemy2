Go to the Empire State and watch the city lights
Hear the noise of millions struggle in the sprawl
Stare into the sky, we're few and far between
Black eyes full of stars, wide with memories

Every street I ever walked
Every home I ever had is lost

Every flower I ever held
Every spring I ever had has died

Every man I ever knew
Every woman I ever had is gone

Everything I ever touched
Everything I ever had has died

Lie down in the park and watch the satellites
Hear the children sing just a breath away
Dance in the heavy air along the interstate
Black lung full of fumes, choke on memories

Every street I ever walked
Every home I ever had is lost

Every flower I ever held
Every spring I ever had has died

Every man I ever knew
Every woman I ever had is gone

Everything I ever touched
Everything I ever had has died
