He has agreed to take me to the ice hotel from the magazine
what we will need is a gleaming key made of ice as well by the finest ice machine
its there that no one will stare at your jaws and your long fur
the claws in your fingers
its the past when the passerby laughed at your strange way of speaking your batteries leaking

oh no, oh god no
they dont know the new zero

uniforms worn
so leisurely
the reindeer skins
the privacy

how was he born?
he's asking me
flapping his fins
very impressively

its there that no one will stare at your jaws and your long fur
the claws in your fingers

its the past when the passerby laughed at your strange way of speaking
your batteries leaking

oh no, he has agreed to take me to the ice hotel

i really dont care and neither does he
if this hotel melts into the sea
polished and so rarer, this way that we see
the coldness helps, its our favorite remedy

it is there that no one will stare at your jaws and your long fur
the claws in your fingers

its the past when the passerby laughed at your strange way of speaking
your batteries leaking, oh no!
