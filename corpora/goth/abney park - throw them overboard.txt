If you map out my psychology
It will look like archaeology
I have no love for this society
I prefer total free autonomy!

Take your new-fangled this and your new-fangled that
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!
Your new-fangled this and your new-fangled that
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!

We've made a art of this horology
To the point of a new theology
I say to hell with modern technology
As we embrace analog mythology!

Take your new-fangled this and your new-fangled that

And you can line them up and throw them overboard!
Your new-fangled this and your new-fangled that
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!

This society's technology
Is an aesthetic anthropophagy
To survive this cultural urology
You have to study alcohology--

Or take your new-fangled this and your new-fangled that
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!
Your new-fangled this and your new-fangled that
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!
