Cutiest girl behind my door
Everybody's hiding in love from war
The beauty broke down their chains somehow
Who's gonna living on my body now

A growing pain within my pop divine
Will I ever regret the line
Switching on the light
I will not reassign
Girlfriend's girlfriends never could be mine

Drop her white pants wide open warm
Now she's slipping on her uniform
And every second would become so misdefine
Girlfriend's girlfriends never could be mine

What can I do?
What can I say?
Choose your weapon, time to pay
Forget about the second day
We could be friends
With a kiss in flow
Choose your weapon, time to go
A military fashion show

Cutiest girl ask for more
Unfortunately, someone's creeping on my floor
An empty glass, a topless babe, a knock on the door
Girlfriend's girlfriends never could be more
