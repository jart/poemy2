You are reaching your goals
But I'm still trapped inside of mine
Before the break of day
You will be gone and far away

In solitude
With no place to run or hide
I hear my own mind cry
And I fall just to see you rise

And I will go down on my knees
And pray the best that I can
I want you to be near...
And I will go down on my kness
And try to make you understand
My deepest fear

With pain in my heart
I will travel on my own
To that place inside
Where I can be alone

In solitude
With no place to run or hide
Again I hear this voice cry out
And I fall just to see you rise

And I will go down on my knees
And pray the best that I can
I want you to be near...
And I will go down on my kness
And try to make you understand
My deepest fear

In solitude
With no place to run or hide
I hear my own mind cry
And I fall just to see you rise

And I will go down on my knees
And pray the best that I can
I want you to be near...
And I will go down on my kness
And try to make you understand
My deepest fear
