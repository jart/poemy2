Iridescent eyes, of the seahorse rise
Treasure she loves, others despise
A shooting star, shant fall very far
Dim fireflies, held in glass jars
April showers, brings May flowers
Dazzling dust, tossed in wind gusts
The trap door is open
The window, half closed
The tapestry curtain vivaciously blows

London Bridge did fall down
My fair lady nearly drown
What is the reason to lock her up,
When already she had such rotten luck?

Bracelets of silver adorn my wrists
Candy kissed from sugared lips

(Candy kisses me)

London Bridge did fall down
My fair lady nearly drown
The London Bridge did fall down
My fair lady nearly drown

London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, my fair lady
Take the key and lock her up
Lock her up, lock her up
Take the key and lock her up
My fair lady
