walking through winter, through snow-white fields 
colder than cold ... for several weeks
and the lost fire's burning miles away 
and the wind whispers stories in her ears

and she's asking: "do you hear these heavenly voices? 
do you hear the preacher who wants you to pray?"

and this night so much colder than every night 
and she says, she likes winter and winter-trees 
and the sun seens so far away tonight 
in the dark and deep, frozen water the light
of the moon under which she dies 
of the moon under which we cry

...death knocking at the door ... I must let him in ... 
life like a river flows ... outside ... stay alive!
ten-thousand good reasons to survive ...

and she's asking: "do you hear these heavenly voices? 
do you hear the preacher who wants you to pray?"

walking through winter, through snow-white fields 
colder than cold ... for several weeks 
and the lost fire's burning miles away 
and the wind whispers stories in her ears

stay alive! ...my dear ... I kiss your cold hands ...
first time ... please stay alive ... I'm loving you ... you're 
loving me ... imagine that you were at home ... 
this night ... please try it! 
don't leave me alone!
