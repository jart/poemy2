You hold the candle I once lit
You shine your light
When you forgive I cry
You run your fingers through my hair
And tell me it's worthwhile, it's all worthwhile

Even when I hate myself
Even when I feel your pain
when you cry
Even when my heart is cold
You assure me it's worthwhile, it's all worthwhile

You see what can't be seen
You repair the damage done to me...
