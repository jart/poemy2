They say "trust on us"
They say "our time will come"
And "your dreams will come alive"
One day, we will find 
No way to cross this line
It's where our worlds collide

This world is not made for you and I
It's build on blood and a million lies

Some say "we don't fit in"
"We're lost in another world"
Their truth will never hold
'Cause, one's heart is one's soul
We're living, day by day
Let them wither, till they're old and grey

This world is not made for you and I
It's build on blood and a million lies

I was blind, but now I see
We are destined for misery
If you're lost, you won't be found
There is no guiding hand of destiny

This world is not made for you and I
It's build on blood and a million lies

They paint the fabric of our lives, down and out
With nowhere to hide
What you miss, what you need, what you lack is a peace of mind
Our worlds collide
