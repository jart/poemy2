Broken people
Hollow and feeble
They're rolling
Rolling up the hill

Rotten ingrate
Stupid mistakes
They're rolling
Rolling up the hill

Wishing wells and cockle shells
They swim throughout my head
My eyes are closing slowly
As I'm lowering my head

Wanting and getting
Silent setting
They're rolling
Rolling up the hill

Robbing and burning
Waisted learning
They're rolling
Rolling up the hill

Wishing wells and cockle shells
They swim throughout my head
My eyes are closing slowly
As I'm lowering my head

Breaking in
In my eyes
I can't see like this
I can't let go
Please help me down
I can't be like this

Seeing them
Them all around
How can they be so sweet?
Sweet

They panic so
Just hold them down
I could live like this

I'm closing in
Hey, all around
I could be like this

Hearing them
Them in my head
How can they be so sweet?
Sweet

They're all around
Hey, hear me say
They're all around, yeah

They're all around
Hey, hear me say
They're all around, yeah

They're all around
Hey, hear me say
How can they be so sweet?
Sweet
