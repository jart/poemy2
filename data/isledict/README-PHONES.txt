README: PHONE CODES and LEXICAL STRESS

The ISLE dictionary adopts phone conventions of the CMU pronouncing
dictionary version 0.6, upon which it is largely based.

Syllable boundaries are marked with a period.

Any phone code that begins with the letters [aeiou] is a syllable
nucleus.  Every syllable nucleus is marked with lexical stress.
Levels of lexical stress are as follows:

  1 = primary stress
  2 = secondary stress (non-reduced vowel)
  0 = reduced

We use the following 39 phone symbols.  Schwa is typically /ah0/, but
may also be derived from any other reduced (stress=0) vowel.  Flap is
marked with the original /t/ or /d/, in intervocalic syllable-initial
reduced context.
